# DSAE-DMM

This is the code of our paper "A Self-supervised DSAE for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition".

Two experimental datasets were used to evaluate the UATR method based on self-supervised feature learning proposed in this paper.

One is the underwater acoustic signal target dataset that we actually adopted from the cooperative project (Cooperative-project Dataset, CP Dataset), and another dataset is the [ShipsEar Dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003682X16301566).

Noting that due to the sensitivity of the data, we are unable to provide the complete dataset and code. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this project, please contact the corresponding author of the paper, Wu Peiran (email: [wupeiran@hrbeu.edu.cn](mailto:wupeiran@hrbeu.edu.cn))  for further information.
