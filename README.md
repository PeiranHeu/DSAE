# DSAE-DMM

This is the code of our paper "A Self-supervised DSAE for Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition"

Two experimental datasets were used to evaluate the UATR method based on self-supervised feature learning proposed in this paper.

One is the underwater acoustic signal target dataset that we actually adopted from the cooperative project (Cooperative-project Dataset, CP Dataset), and another dataset is the ShipsEar dataset.
